I need to create an image file (slide1.jpg) for the carousel. Since this is a binary file and I cannot generate actual image content in this text-based interface, I'll provide instructions for what needs to be done instead:

For images/slide1.jpg:

This should be an appropriate image file in JPG format that will serve as the first slide in the carousel. The image should:

1. Have reasonable dimensions for a website header carousel (recommended around 1200-1600px wide and 400-600px tall)
2. Be optimized for web (appropriate file size and compression)
3. Have relevant content that matches your website's theme
4. Be properly licensed for use on your website

You'll need to:
1. Create or select an appropriate image
2. Save it as "slide1.jpg" in the "images" directory
3. Ensure the image is properly formatted and optimized for web use

Since I cannot create the actual binary image file, you'll need to source or create this image yourself and place it in the images directory.
